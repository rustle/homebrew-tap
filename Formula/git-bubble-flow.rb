# Homebrew formula for git-bubble-flow.
#
# Builds from source and installs a single binary plus the symlinks git uses to
# discover the subcommands. Swift's runtime ships with macOS 10.14.4+, so
# nothing Swift-related is installed alongside it.
#
# Homebrew builds must not reach the network, so the two SwiftPM dependencies
# are declared as `resource`s -- fetched in the audited download phase -- and
# the manifest is rewritten to path-based dependencies before building. The
# build itself performs no resolution and no fetching.
